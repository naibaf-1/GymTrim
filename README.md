## Purpose & Benefits
GymTrim is a fitness app designed to help you document your training data. While it can help you track your progress, **there is no guarantee that it will improve your athleticism or health**. All training data is recorded and stored locally on your device—**your data remains private and is never shared**.

## Features

### Store Plans & Exercises
- Easily add and edit exercises and plans directly in the app.
- Add images to exercises and colors to plans for easier recognition.
- Add notes to plans and exercises; all will be displayed during training.

### Training Mode
- Tick off completed repetitions during your workout.
- Get reminders for the next repetition (if activated in settings).
- Exercises are automatically marked as completed once finished.

### Track Your Progress
- During training, data such as average weight and exercise volume is automatically calculated and saved.
- After training, you can compare new data to previous training sessions.

### Calculators
- Built-in calculators, such as a BMI calculator, are available in the data section.

### Further Features
- Material You design (and default theme)
- Auto-save for all data
- Search for exercises and plans
- Different sounds for reminders
- Swipe-to-delete functionality
- English and German translations
- Light and dark mode
- Import and export data
