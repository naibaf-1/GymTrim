# GymTrim: Version 1.0 "halcyon"

## Purpose & Benefits
GymTrim is a fitness app designed to help you document your training data, but there is **no guarantee that it will improve your athleticism or health**. Your training data is recorded and stored locally on your device, allowing you to review your progress over time. **Your data remains private and is never shared.**

## Features
### Store Plans & Exercises:
Easely add and edit your exercises and plans directly in the app. Add images to your exercises and colors to your plans in order to make them easier to recognise. Its also possible to add notes to plans and exercises. Evrything will be displayed during the training.
### Training Mode:
In training mode, the user can tick off completed repetitions and receive reminders for the next repetition, if this has been activated in the settings. As soon as an exercise has been completed, the app automatically marks it as completed.
### Catch your training progress
During the training certain training data like e.g.: the average weight or the volume of an exercise is automatically calculated and safed. After the training the user can see this data in the training section in comparision to older data of the selected exercise.
### Different Calculators
In the data section are also some calculators like e.g.: a BMI calculator.
