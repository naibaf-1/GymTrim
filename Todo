Optional:
Link to F-Droid Listing:
If your app is published on F-Droid, you can make “F-Droid” in the installation section a direct link to GymTrim’s page.

APK Download from Releases:
If you host APKs in your GitHub Releases, make the “Releases page” link absolute for easier access.

Consistency in Feature List:
“Edit a plan” and “Edit an exercise” (in screenshots) — double-check for typos like “Edit an plan”.

Muss:
Release Version
    If you’re ready, create an initial release/tag so people can easily find the latest stable version.

Sensitive files
    Ensure no sensitive or personal files are accidentally included (your .idea directory is present, which is usually IDE-specific and not needed in public repos).
