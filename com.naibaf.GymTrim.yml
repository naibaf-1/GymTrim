    - Tick off completed repetitions during your workout.
    - Get reminders for the next repetition (if activated in settings).
    - Exercises are automatically marked as completed once finished.
  - Track Your Progress:
    - During training, data such as average weight and exercise volume is automatically calculated and saved.
    - After training, you can compare new data to previous training sessions.
  - Calculators:
    - Built-in calculators, such as a BMI calculator, are available in the data section.
  - Further Features:
    - Material You design (and default theme)
    - Auto-save for all data
    - Search for exercises and plans
    - Different sounds for reminders
